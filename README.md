# STRESS-LEVEL-ANALYSIS-BY-USING-SUPERVISED-LEARNING-APPROACHES
The stress-detection system is proposed based on physiological signals. Parameters like galvanic skin response (GSR), stress rate (HR), Body temperature, Muscle tension, Blood pressure are proposed to provide information on the state of mind of an individual, due to their non-intrusiveness and non-invasiveness.
# ABOUT
Stress is a prevalent issue affecting individuals across various domains of life, including work, education, and personal relationships. Identifying and understanding stress levels is crucial for effective intervention and support.This abstract presents an overview of a study that focuses on stress level analysis using supervised learning approaches. The objective of this research is to develop a reliable and accurate system that can predict stress levels based on various input features. The study employs supervised learning techniques, which utilize labelled training data to build a predictive model. The model is trained to classify stress levels based on the input features and corresponding stress labels. The proposed methodology involves several stages. Firstly, relevant features related to stress are identified, such as heart rate, sleep patterns, physical activity, and self-reported emotions. These features are extracted from individuals using wearable devices, surveys, and other data collection methods. The implications of this research are significant, as an accurate stress level analysis system can aid in identifying individuals at risk of high stress and enable timely interventions. It can be utilized in various settings, including healthcare, workplaces, and educational institutions, to promote well-being and prevent stress-related health issues. In conclusion, this study aims to develop a stress level analysis system using supervised learning approaches. The results of this research can contribute to the development of personalized stress management interventions, leading to improved overall mental health and well-being for individuals.
